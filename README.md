Convert [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility scan results to the [SARIF format](http://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/). Provides both a TypeScript API and a CLI tool.

Use this with the [Sarif Viewer Build Tab Azure DevOps Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sariftools.sarif-viewer-build-tab) to visualize accessibility scan results in the build results of an [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) build.

## Usage

Before using axe-sarif-converter, you will need to run an [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility scan to produce some axe results to convert. Typically, you would do this by using an axe integration library for your favorite browser automation tool ([@axe-core/puppeteer](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/puppeteer), [@axe-core/webdriverjs](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/webdriverjs), [cypress-axe](https://github.com/avanslaars/cypress-axe)).

axe-sarif-converter exports a single function, named `convertAxeToSarif`. Use it like this:

```ts
import * as Axe from 'axe-core';
import * as AxePuppeteer from '@axe-core/puppeteer';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as Puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
import * as util from 'util';

import { convertAxeToSarif, SarifLog } from 'axe-sarif-converter';

test('my accessibility test', async () => {
    // This example uses @axe-core/puppeteer, but you can use any axe-based
    // library that outputs axe scan results in the default axe output format
    const testPage: Puppeteer.Page = /* ... set up your test page ... */;
    const axeResults: Axe.AxeResults = await new AxePuppeteer(testPage).analyze();

    // Perform the conversion
    const sarifResults: SarifLog = convertAxeToSarif(axeResults);

    // Output a SARIF file, perhaps for use with a Sarif Viewer tool
    await util.promisify(fs.writeFile)(
        './test-results/my-accessibility-test.sarif',
        JSON.stringify(sarifResults),
        { encoding: 'utf8' });
}
```

You can also use axe-sarif-converter as a command line tool:

```bash
# @axe-core/cli is used here for example purposes only; you could also run axe-core
# using your library of choice and JSON.stringify the results.
npx @axe-core/cli https://accessibilityinsights.io --save ./sample-axe-results.json

npx axe-sarif-converter --input-files ./sample-axe-results.json --output-file ./sample-axe-results.sarif
```

See `npx axe-sarif-converter --help` for full command line option details.

## Samples

The [microsoft/axe-pipelines-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/axe-pipelines-samples) project contains full sample code that walks you through integrating this library into your project, from writing a test to seeing results in Azure Pipelines.

## Version numbers

The version number of this library is **independent** from the version numbers of the axe-core inputs and SARIF outputs it supports.

-   axe-sarif-converter version 2.x supports input from version ^3.2.0 || ^4.0.0 of axe-core (tested with 3.2.2, 3.3.2, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, 3.5.5, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 4.1.1, 4.2.0, 4.3.2, 4.4.1, and 4.6.3) and outputs SARIF v2.1
-   axe-sarif-converter version 1.x supports input from version >= 3.2.0 < 3.3.0 of axe-core (tested with 3.2.2) and outputs SARIF v2.0

Note that the SARIF format _does not use semantic versioning_, and there are breaking changes between the v2.0 and v2.1 SARIF formats. If you need compatibility with a SARIF viewer that only supports v2.0, you should use version 1.x of this library.

## Contributing

To get started working on the project:

1. Install dependencies:

    - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version)
    - `npm install -g yarn`
    - `yarn install`

1. Run all build, lint, and test steps:

    - `yarn precheckin`

1. Run the CLI tool with your changes:

    - `yarn build`
    - `node dist/cli.js`
    - Alternately, register a linked global `axe-sarif-converter` command with `npm install && npm link` (yarn doesn't work for this; see [yarnpkg/yarn#1585](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1585))

### Updating axe-core version

This package attempts to maintain backwards compatibility with axe-core versions ^3.2.2. We maintain
test cases using pinned output from multiple axe-core versions under `/src/test-resources/`, so updating
the version of axe-core we support involves generating new output for the new versions.

Ideally we'd specify axe-core as a peer dependency; unfortunately, changing this now would be a breaking
change, so we're waiting to change this until we would need to make a breaking change anyway.

To update the package and test cases to account for a new axe-core version:

1. Update the version of axe-core in `yarn.lock` (_not_ `package.json`); usually dependabot will cover this. If updating to the latest version, this can be accomplished using `yarn upgrade axe-core`.
1. Build the repo with:
    ```
    yarn install
    yarn build
    ```
1. Update the versions of @axe-core/cli, @axe-core/puppeteer, and axe-core in `src/test-resources/generator/package.json`
1. Generate test resource files for the new version with:

    ```
    cd src/test-resources/generator
    yarn install
    yarn generate
    ```

1. Manually compare the diff of `/src/test-resources/basic-axe-vPREVIOUS.sarif` and `/src/test-resources/basic-axe-vNEW.sarif`; the only differences should be the version numbers.
1. Manually compare the diff of `/src/test-resources/w3citylights-axe-vPREVIOUS.sarif` and `/src/test-resources/w3citylights-axe-vNEW.sarif`; in addition to version number differences, you should see some differences based on new/removed rules between the axe versions.
1. Add test cases involving the new files to the integration tests in `src/index.test.ts` and `src/cli.test.ts`
1. Update snapshots (`yarn test -u`)
1. Update this README's `Version numbers` section to note which versions we've tested against.
